# SPECS

SPECS is a side-chain-orientation-included protein model-native similarity metric for improved evaluation of protein structural models. SPECS stands for Superposition-based Protein Embedded CA SC score. It combines side-chain orientation and global distance based measures in an integrated framework using the united-residue model of polypeptide conformation for computing model-native similarity. SPECS captures both global and local quality aspects when evaluating structural similarity and is sensitive to minute variations in side-chain, thereby being a robust evaluation metric covering a wide range of modeling scenarios and various aspects of structural similarity. SPECS has the value in (0,1], where 1 indicates a perfect match between two structures.

## Requirement
1. Linux system: SPECS is tested on on x86_64 redhat linux system
2. GCC compiler

## Installation
You can run SPECS from <a href="http://watson.cse.eng.auburn.edu/SPECS/">SPECS web-server</a>. However, for large-scale benchmarkingm we strongly recommend that you install and run SPECS locally.
SPECS is a stand-alone application. To download and install SPECS, please type,
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bhattacharya-Lab/SPECS.git
$ cd SPECS
$ g++ -o SPECS SPECS.cpp
```
## Usage
To run SPECS, type
```
$ ./SPECS
```
You will see the following output
```

Error! Model file must be provided

Usage: ./SPECS -m model -n native
   -m model  : model pdb file
   -n native : native pdb file
   -h help   : this message
```
<b>Example commands to run SPECS</b>
```
$ cd SPECS
$ ./SPECS -m example/sample_model.pdb -n example/sample_native.pdb
```
## Output
SPECS offer dynamic input validation and offers instantaneous output. Upon running the above command, you will see following output
